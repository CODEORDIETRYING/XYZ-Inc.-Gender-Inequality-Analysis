# XYZ-Inc.-Gender-Inequality-Analysis
The company in question - XYZ, was recently featured in the news with the headline, "XYZ, the Manufacturing Patriarchy" This doesn't look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale into other regions. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues. The owners of the company were keen on addressing these issues across all its departments operating in three states and reached out to me in order to take a look at their company's data and proffer areas that need immediate attention. As part of a never-ending journey of learning and application in the field of data analytics and data science, I took up this project,  where I had to make use of T-SQL for Ad-Hoc data analysis and Power BI for visualization and final  presentation of findings and recommendations to stakeholders. This project involved a deep dive into the HR data of this  company (XYZ for confidentiality) in order to ascertain gender biases in its workforce. In some tech companies and stem-related career paths, there has been a long-standing preference for hiring male candidates.
